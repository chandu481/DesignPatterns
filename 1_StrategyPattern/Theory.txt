The Strategy Pattern typically involves three parts:

Strategy (Interface) – defines a common interface for all supported algorithms.

Concrete Strategies – implement different variations of the algorithm.

Context – uses a Strategy object and delegates the work to it.

The Strategy Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows you to define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one, and make them interchangeable.
